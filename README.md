# üå± Terraform Daily Challenge ‚Äì 28 Days of Infrastructure as Code

Welcome to my personal **Terraform learning journey**! This repo documents a **28-day challenge** to build hands-on experience with Terraform by doing small, practical projects every day. The focus is on **Azure**, but most concepts apply across all cloud platforms.

Each folder (`dayXX-*`) contains:
- Terraform configuration files
- A dedicated `README.md` describing what I did that day
- My reflections, troubleshooting notes, and useful commands

## üåê Quick Azure Setup for Terraform

Before using the Terraform projects in this repo, run the environment setup script:

```bash
bash setup-env.sh
