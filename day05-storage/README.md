# Day 5 - Manage Storage Containers & Blobs

Todayâ€™s task was to provision an Azure Storage Account using Terraform, then create a private blob container inside it.

- Deployed `azurerm_storage_account`
- Created `azurerm_storage_container`
- Output the blob endpoint URL

Learned how to manage storage and prepare for blob-based services in cloud projects.
